    <h2>About me:</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! I am 23 years old. I graduated from St. Petersburg Mining
      University with a degree in engineering. Now I'm learning Fronend
      development. I set myself a goal: by February 2023, to get a job as a
      junior in an IT company. In the future, I would like to learn how to write
      smart contracts for Web3 in Solidity and Rust.
